**BugRiskEvaluatorML** is a Streamlit-based machine learning project that predicts the risk of bugs in code commits and provides developer-specific insights to improve software quality.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Bug Risk Prediction**  
  Upload commit history CSVs to train a Random Forest model and predict the likelihood of bugs in new commits.

- **Suggested Safer Commits**  
  Generate commit combinations to minimize risk under a defined threshold.

- **Personalized Developer Analysis**  
  Provides human-readable tips for each developer based on historical low-risk commits.  

  *Example:*  
  > "Dev1 performs best when changing 10â€“50 lines of code and modifying 1â€“3 files; optimal conditions include commit type as 'bug fix' and work in 'core module'."

- **Experiment Section**  
  Test a new commit interactively and view predicted risk in real time.

- **Feature Importance**  
  Visualizes which commit features contribute most to bug risk.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/BugDetectorML.git
cd BugDetectorML

## ðŸ“¦ Installation


```
### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the App
streamlit run bug_detector_app.py

## ðŸ›  CSV Format

Input CSV should have the following columns:

lines_changed, files_changed, message_length, developer, developer_bug_rate, commit_type, code_area, label

commit_type: 0 = new feature/refactor, 1 = bug fix

code_area: 0 = side module, 1 = core module

label: 0 = no bug, 1 = bug

### Generating Synthetic Data

Use the included script to generate synthetic commits:
python generate_synthetic_csv.py

Developer-specific bug rates can be set to simulate realistic behavior.
